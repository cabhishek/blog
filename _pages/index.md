I currently work at [The Motley Fool](http://fool.com) in Washington DC and on [Datathletics]() a project I helped Co-Found.

I'm interested in Product development, open source technologies and currently write software in Javascript/Nodejs, Python and Golang. 
And I've also recently ventured into datascience and data visualization world.
