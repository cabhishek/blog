Aloha! My name is Abhishek, and I'm a traveler|developer currently based in beautiful San Francisco. I am happily employed at [Netflix](http://www.netflix.com/) and previously I worked at [The Motley Fool](http://www.glassdoor.com/Overview/Working-at-Motley-Fool-EI_IE10051.11,22.htm) and co-founded [Datathletics LLC]() a data science company to help triathletes make better race decisions.

My interests lie in product development, programming languages, data analysis and visualization. I enjoy traveling and programming. And I'm often productive when those two combine.
