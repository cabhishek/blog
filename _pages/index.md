Hi! I'm an engineer | volunteer | cyclist currently based in beautiful San Francisco. I am happily employed at [Netflix](http://www.netflix.com/) and currently serve as a chapter leader for [DataKind SF](http://www.datakind.org/chapters/datakind-sf). Previously I worked at [The Motley Fool](http://www.glassdoor.com/Overview/Working-at-Motley-Fool-EI_IE10051.11,22.htm) and co-founded Datathletics LLC, a data science company to help triathletes make better race decisions.

My interests lie in product development, compilers, data science and infrastructure, and storytelling. I care deeply about utilizing my skills and time for social good.

If you think our interest overlap, you can reach me through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhishekkapatkar/) and if youâ€™re looking for someone to ride with, find me on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/1714915).
