Aloha! My name is Abhishek, and I'm a volunteer | engineer | traveler currently based in beautiful [San Francisco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco). I am happily employed at [Netflix](http://www.netflix.com/) and currently serve as a chapter leader for [DataKind SF](http://www.datakind.org/chapters/datakind-sf). Previously I worked at [The Motley Fool](http://www.glassdoor.com/Overview/Working-at-Motley-Fool-EI_IE10051.11,22.htm) and co-founded [Datathletics LLC]() a data science company to help triathletes make better race decisions.

My interests lie in product development, languages (computer and human), compilers, data analysis, visualization, and storytelling.
